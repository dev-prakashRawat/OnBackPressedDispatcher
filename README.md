# OnBackPressedDispatcher
onBackPressed is deprecated. Use OnBackPressedDispatcher to handle backPressed.

ComponentActivity, the base class for FragmentActivity and AppCompatActivity, allows you to control the behavior of the Back button by using its OnBackPressedDispatcher, which you can retrieve by calling getOnBackPressedDispatcher().

In this dummy project you can find how to use OnBackPressedDispatcher to add OnBackPressedCallbacks in order to handle backPressed.
